# Healthcare Project Dashboard

## Project Objective
Analyzed a healthcare dataset focused on patients to uncover insights that improve outcomes and reduce medical costs. Tools used include Spreadsheets, SQL, and Power BI to explore demographics, billing, admissions, and test results for better healthcare decision-making.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/09Nangs/Healthcare-project-Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/a25c92a5ec18f23794fa4d900289349fe0ccb096/Health%20Care%20Project.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the frequency of each medical condition?
- What is the gender distribution across different illnesses?
- How are most patients admitted?
- Detect spikes or drops in admissions
- Which hospitals handle which conditions more often?
