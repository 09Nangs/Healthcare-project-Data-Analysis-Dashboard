## Project Objective
Analyzed a healthcare dataset focused on patients to uncover insights that improve outcomes and reduce medical costs. Tools used include Spreadsheets, SQL, and Power BI to explore demographics, billing, admissions, and test results for better healthcare decision-making
# Dataset Used

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the frequency of each medical condition?
- What is the gender distribution across different illnesses?
- How are most patients admitted?
- Detect spikes or drops in admissions
- Which hospitals handle which conditions more often?
- Relationship between patient age, medical condition, and healthcare cost.
- Which conditions generate the most billing revenue?

## Project insight
This project uncovered key billing and care trends among patients across various hospitals
Some hospitals consistently billed higher for similar conditions, suggesting opportunities for standardizing treatment costs
By analyzing age groups, test results, and admission types, the project reveals critical patterns that can guide better resource allocation, patient education, and care planning to reduce unnecessary costs while improving patient outcomes

## Final Conclusion
Through data exploration using Spreadsheets, SQL, and Power BI, this project demonstrated the power of healthcare analytics in identifying cost drivers and care inefficiencies. By focusing on cancer patients, a group often subject to high and variable medical costs, the project demonstrates how hospitals and policymakers can utilize data to promote transparency, optimize billing practices, and improve care quality. With better data-driven insights, we can move closer to a healthcare system that is not just reactive but proactive, patient-centered, and cost-effective.
